# StreamCraft Studios Custom HTML Library

A JavaScript library for building custom UI controls in StreamCraft Studios live broadcast graphics.

```

2. Initialize the client:

const client = new IframeClient("my-controller");
```

3. Send data to update graphics:
```javascript
client.setPayload({ text: "Hello World" });
```
