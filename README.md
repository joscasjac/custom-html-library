# StreamCraft Studios Custom HTML Library

A JavaScript library for building custom UI controls in StreamCraft Studios live broadcast graphics.

## Overview

This library enables communication between custom HTML interfaces and StreamCraft Studios through iframe messaging. It allows you to create custom controls for specific layers in your composition instead of using the default overlay editor.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Bidirectional messaging between your custom UI and StreamCraft
- **Payload Management**: Send and receive data to control your graphics
- **State Awareness**: Know when your graphics are live or in preview mode
- **Template Information**: Access metadata about your composition and templates
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that works with any HTML/CSS/JavaScript framework

## Quick Start

1. Include the library in your HTML:
```html
    <script src="https://joscasjac.github.io/custom-html-library/iframe-client.js"></script>
```

2. Initialize the client:
```javascript
const client = new IframeClient("my-controller");
```

3. Send data to update graphics:
```javascript
client.setPayload({ text: "Hello World" });
```
